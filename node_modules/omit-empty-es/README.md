## `omit-empty-es`

This is a (_temporary_) **fork** of the [`omit-empty`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/omit-empty) library by [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert) and is meant to produce a bundle that is properly consumed by modern build tools (Babel, Webpack, etc.).

> Hopefully we can merge those changes upstream and this repository/package won't be necessary anymore.

### Install

```bash
npm install --save omit-empty-es
```

```bash
yarn add omit-empty-es
```

### Usage

```js
import omitEmpty from 'omit-empty-es';
```
